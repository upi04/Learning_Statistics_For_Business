# Statistical Analysis Project  

This repository contains various modules and resources for conducting statistical analysis, focusing on regression, model evaluation, and statistical inference.  

## Project Structure  

1. **1_Data_And_Measurement**  
   This module provides an introduction to data measurement concepts, including types of data, measurement scales, and data collection methods.  

2. **2_Statistical_Inference**  
   Covers the basics of statistical inference, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-value interpretation.  

3. **3_Linear_Regression_1**  
   Focuses on simple linear regression analysis, introducing regression equations, assumptions, and evaluation metrics.  

4. **4_Linear_Regression_with_Multiple_Predictors**  
   Explores multiple linear regression, highlighting how to incorporate multiple predictors and assess their impact on the dependent variable.  

5. **5_Model_Assumptions**  
   Provides a detailed overview of the assumptions underlying regression models (e.g., linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and normality of residuals) and diagnostic techniques.  

6. **6_Transformation_and_Regression**  
   Discusses data transformation techniques (e.g., log, square root, and normalization) and their use in regression models to meet assumptions or improve model performance.  

7. **7_Sample_Size_Decision**  
   Explains how to determine the appropriate sample size for regression models and hypothesis testing to ensure statistical power.  

8. **8_Logistic_Regression**  
   Introduces logistic regression for binary outcomes. Topics include odds ratios, interpretation of coefficients, and model evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC curves).
