Statistical Analysis Project
This repository contains various modules and resources for conducting statistical analysis, focusing on regression, model evaluation, and statistical inference.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

1_Data_And_Measurement
This module provides an introduction to data measurement concepts. It includes information on types of data, measurement scales, and data collection methods.

2_Statistical_Inference
Covers the basics of statistical inference, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-value interpretation.

3_Linear_Regression_1
Focuses on simple linear regression analysis. It introduces regression equations, assumptions, and evaluation metrics.

4_Linear_Regression_with_Multiple_Predictors
Explores multiple linear regression, highlighting how to incorporate multiple predictors and assess their impact on the dependent variable.

5_Model_Assumptions
Provides a detailed overview of the assumptions underlying regression models (e.g., linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and normality of residuals) and diagnostic techniques.

6_Transformation_and_Regression
Discusses data transformation techniques (e.g., log, square root, and normalization) and their use in regression models to meet assumptions or improve model performance.

7_Sample_Size_Decision
Explains how to determine the appropriate sample size for regression models and hypothesis testing to ensure statistical power.

8_Logistic_Regression
Introduces logistic regression for binary outcomes. Topics include odds ratios, interpretation of coefficients, and model evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC curves).
